#### 2. Select large corpora of the same type: one for each region


To select comparable corpora for the regions of Bosnia, Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia, first check available corpora for each of these regions. Since Bosnian and Montenegrin have the least resources, start with one of them.

<img src="images\Capture1-6.JPG" alt="web page 1-6" width="610"/>

- Click on the corpus title to see the corpus description and other relevant information.

<img src="images\Capture1-7.JPG" alt="web page 1-7" width="610"/>

Here you can also see if the corpus is available in the KonText and NoSketchEngine concordancers.

- To see which corpora are available in all given languages, turn off the **Language** filter and review the **Subject** option in the **Limit your search** pane. (NOTE: The **Type: corpus** filter should still be active.)

- Given that the corpus from our example (meWaC) is a web corpus, choose **web corpus** from the **Subject** list to see available web corpora for all languages in the repository.

<img src="images\Capture1-8.JPG" alt="web page 1-8" width="610"/>

NOTE: If you don't see **web corpus** in the subject list, click on the **...View more** option to expand the list.

- There will be 10 results for the selected filters.

<img src="images\Capture1-9.JPG" alt="web page 1-9" width="610"/>

- To find comparable corpora for all languages in the scope, check the results by clicking on the corpus name and reviewing the details.


<br />

*NOTE: The slWaC corpus is not currently visible in the repository, but it can be accessed and searched in both concordancers.*

<br />

-----
As we can see, there are WaC web corpora for all languages in the scope with a sufficient number of words. They contain texts extracted from the crawled HTML pages from their respective domains (.si, .rs, .hr, .ba, .me). We take these corpora as representative of regional variation. 

Also, all of these corpora are available in the NoSketchEngine and KonTekst concordancers.

<img src="images\Capture2-4.JPG" alt="web page 2-4" width="410"/>

<br />

<br />

*You can explore all provided search options. We will use CQL (Corpus Query Language) syntax for all searches. Detailed instructions and a description of the QCL syntax can be found [here](https://www.sketchengine.eu/documentation/corpus-querying/).*

<br />

- Select **CQL** radio button and and the **CQL:** search box will become active.

<img src="images\Capture2-5.JPG" alt="web page 2-5" width="410"/>

- To search for "direktor" lemma, enter the following regular expression in the search box: [lemma="direktor"]. Then click **Make Concordance** button or press Enter.


<img src="images\Capture2-6.JPG" alt="web page 2-6" width="410"/>


The search results page is displayed with the number of hits and the number per million words of a given lemma, in this case "direktor".

<img src="images\Capture2-7.JPG" alt="web page 2-7" width="610"/>

Or you can click the info icon <img src="images\Capture2-8.JPG" alt="web page 2-8" width="15"/>), and **Concordance description** tab pops out with basic information.

<img src="images\Capture2-9.JPG" alt="web page 2-9" width="410"/>

<br />

<br />

-----
*Raw count (number of occurrences) is the number of hits*, in this example 145,104, and that means that lemma "direktor" appears 145,104 times in **slWaC** corpus.

-----

<br />

- Enter this number in the **Slovenia / M / direktor** filed of the table.

- Repeat these steps for the lemma "direktorica" to find out the raw count for **Slovenia / F / direktorica**, and fill in the result in the table [26,880]

To change the corpus, you can click **Home** in the left-hand menu and choose another corpus from the **Overview of available corpora** table.

OR

You can select another corpus from the dropdown list in the **Corpus** field of the search form

<img src="images\Capture2-10.JPG" alt="web page 2-10" width="410"/>

- Repeat queries in all relevant corpora for all relevant lemmas.

**KonTekst:**

- To open KonTekst concordancer, go to https://www.clarin.si/kontext/corpora/corplist or click **CONCORDANCERS** > **KonTekst** on the CLARIN starting page (http://www.clarin.si/info/about/).

<img src="images\Capture3-1.JPG" alt="web page 3-1" width="610"/>

<br />

<br />

Slovenian corpora are listed separately at the beginning of the table. Expand the **Representative** tab in **Slovene corpora** menu, and scroll down to the **slWaC (Slovene Web)** corpus.

<br />

<img src="images\Capture3-2.JPG" alt="web page 3-2" width="610"/>

- Click **slWaC (Slovene Web)**

A new window with the search form will be diplayed. Again, we will be using CQL sintax, so click on the arrow to expand the **Query Type** dropdown list and select **CQL**


<img src="images\Capture3-3.JPG" alt="web page 3-3" width="410"/>

The **Query** field changes to **CQL**. Enter **[lemma="direktor"]** in the search box and click the **Search** button or press Enter.

<img src="images\Capture3-4.JPG" alt="web page 3-4" width="410"/>

The search results page is displayed with the number of hits, instances per million positions (i.p.m.), average reduced frequency (ARF) and other info for a given lemma, in this case "direktor".

<img src="images\Capture3-5.JPG" alt="web page 3-5" width="610"/>

<br />

-----
*Raw count (number of occurrences) is the number of hits*, in this example 145,104, and that means that lemma "direktor" appears 145,104 times in **slWaC** corpus.

##### 4.2 Calculate the ratio of feminine to masculine nouns for each set of nouns in each region: 


<br />

To calculate the ratio of feminine to musculine nouns in specific corpora, we will observe the share of feminine forms in relation to the total number of occurrences.


<br />

-----

<div align="center"> 

ratio of feminine nouns:

![Ratio(F) = \frac{Total(F)}{Total(F+M)}\times100](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?Ratio(F)=\frac{Total(F)}{Total(F+M)}\times100)

</div>

-----

<br />

Example: Ratio of feminine nouns "direktorica" and "direktorka" to musculine noun "direktor" in bsWaC is:

![\frac{8,736}{84,565}\times100=10.33\%](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\frac{8,736}{84,565}\times100=10.33\%)

<br />

Enter this number in the in the **Bosnia / %F** filed of the table. 

<br />

To calculate **%M**, simply subtract **%F** from 100 or you can check the result by calculating ratio of masculine nouns: 

![Ratio(M) = \frac{Total(M)}{Total(F+M)}\times100](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?Ratio(M)=\frac{Total(M)}{Total(F+M)}\times100)

|       |   &nbsp;&nbsp;%F  &nbsp;&nbsp;     |   &nbsp;&nbsp;%M    &nbsp;&nbsp;                      |                      |
|------ | ----------- |---------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Bosnia    |     10.33%    &nbsp;&nbsp;  |          89.67%    &nbsp;&nbsp;               |                      |
| Croatia   |    11.39%       |            88.61%                 |                      | 
| Montenegro &nbsp;&nbsp;|    21.38%       |            78.61%                 |                      |
| Serbia    |      10.52%     |           89.48%                  |                      |
| Slovenia  |     15.63%      |             84.37%                |                      |



<br />

##### 4.3 Observations 

- Raw counts are hard to interpret, the trends become obvious when we compare ratios 
- While overall female to male ratio in the society is approximately 1:1, the ratio between female and male directors is around 1:10
- There is regional variation: Montenegro > Slovenia > Croatia > Serbia > Bosnia 
- Montenegro is somewhat surprising against its reputation of a very traditional, conservative society (potentially a prejudice)  
- Otherwise, more developed countries (measured by the GDP for instance), more female directors  

<br />

#### 5. Feminine vs. masculine nouns describing occupations with lower social status. 

<br />


##### 5.1 Find the following raw counts (number of occurrences) for feminine and masculine nouns (Engl. *teacher*) for each set of nouns in each region: 

<br />

As decribed above, search for 
 * **nastavnica**/**nastavnik** in bsWaC, hrWaC, meWaC, srWaC 
 * **učiteljica**/**učitelj** in slWaC


|   	|  F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	| M  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	|  Total &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	|
|---	    |---	|---	|---	|
|Bosnia   	|  1,500 	|  13,099 	|   14,599	|
|Croatia    |   4,576	|   43,148	|   47,724	|
|Montenegro |   727	|   7,396	|   8,123	|
|Serbia 	|   2,421	|   33,886	|   36,307	|

<br />

##### 5.2 Calculate the ratio of feminine to masculine nouns for each set of nouns in each region: 

<br />

<br />

To calculate the ratio of feminine to masculine nouns in specific corpora, we will observe the share of feminine forms in relation to the total number of occurrences, as shown above.


Example: Ratio of feminine nouns "nastavnica" to musculine nouns "nastavnik" in bsWaC is:

<div align="center">

![\frac{1,500}{14,599}\times100=10.23\%](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\frac{1,500}{14,599}\times100=10.27\%)

</div>

Enter this number in the in the **Bosnia / %F** filed of the table. 

To calculate **%M**, simply subtract **%F** from 100.  



|       |   &nbsp;&nbsp;%F       |   &nbsp;&nbsp;%M                          |                      |
|------ | ----------- |---------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Bosnia    |     10.27%      |          89.73%                   |                      |

##### 5.3 Observations 

- Even fewer female teachers in all the countries except in Slovenia
- This is surprising because we know that, in reality, most teachers are women 
- We conclude that female teachers don't make it to the news and the public communication, despite being very rather numerous
- The difference especially big in Montenegro and Serbia 
- The next search should be limited to singular form, potentially also to subcorpora

###  Part three: Semantic and social roles 

---

#### 6. Find the ratio of feminine to masculine subjects in each region for the following three verbs: misliti (think), os(j)ećati (feel), izjaviti (state, communicate to the media).



              | misliti      |    os(j)ećati      |      izjaviti     |       
              |              |    čutiti          |                   |

To find feminine or masculine subjects for a particular verb, we need a verb form that has gender information. That would be a participle.

- Go to **MSD index** and find the tags for partiples

<img src="images\Capture4-5.JPG" alt="web page 4-5" width="610"/>

NOTE: srWaC, hrWaC, bsWaC and meWaC are using the same tagset (Serbo-Croatian MSD), while slWac has different tagset

srWaC, hrWaC, bsWaC, meWaC: 
	
    Vmp-sm
    Vmp-sf
    Vmp-sn 
    Vmp-pm
    Vmp-pf
    Vmp-pn


slWaC:

    Ggnd-em
    Ggnd-ez
    Ggnd-es
    Ggnd-mm
    Ggnd-mz
    Ggnd-ms
    Ggnd-dm
    Ggnd-dz
    Ggnd-ds

On the [CQL basics](https://www.sketchengine.eu/documentation/cql-basics/#start) page find the rules of the CQL syntax:

<img src="images\Capture4-6.JPG" alt="web page 4-6" width="410"/>

<img src="images\Capture4-7.JPG" alt="web page 4-7" width="410"/>

In the **CQL** search field, enter 

- for srWaC, hrWaC, bsWaC, meWaC: **[lemma="misliti" & tag = "Vmp-.f"]** 

- for slWaC: **[lemma="misliti" & tag="Ggnd-.z"]**

to find all occurrences of feminine forms in corpora. We use the full stop symbol in the place of the letter that represents the number in the MSD. This way, we obtain both singular and plural forms (also dual in Slovenian).


To find all occurrences of masculine forms in corpora, enter 

- for srWaC, hrWaC, bsWaC, meWaC: **[lemma="misliti" & tag="Vmp-.m"]** 

- for slWaC: **[lemma="misliti" & tag="Ggnd-.m"]**



Repeat these steps for all the verbs in all the corpora and enter the results in the table.

<br />

To calculate the ratio of feminine to masculine subjects, observe the share of feminine forms (F) in relation to the total number of occurrences (M+F). 

Applying the same formula as above, we get:

<br />



|   	|  %F (misliti)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	| %F (os(j)ećati/čutiti)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	|  %F (izjaviti) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	|
|---	    |---	|---	|---	|
|Bosnia   	|   30.86%	|   37.48%	|  17.66% 	|
|Croatia    |   30.16%	|  39.46% 	|  19.11% 	|
|Montenegro | 20.30% 	|  34.95% 	|  17.34% 	|
|Serbia 	|   19.96%	|  31.46% 	|  17.34%	|
|Slovenia   |  25.63% 	|  34.82% 	|   20.25%	|

#### 7. Describe the trends in 6.: 

##### 7.1 Are there any regional patterns? 


- Slovenian has most feminine forms in the third column, but, somewhat surprisingly, not in the other two columns
- Overall lowest ratios in Serbian (fewest female subjects)


##### 7.2 Are there any other patterns?  

- Ratio F to M depends on the domain associated with the verb; in all the countries, we see most feminine subjects with the verb 'feel', than with 'think', and then with 'state'


##### 7.3 What do they mean? 

The verb 'think' is typically associated with the rational domain, while 'feel' with the domain of emotions. The observed ratios agree with the stereotypical association of women with the domain of feelings rather than thoughts. This means that the mentions of women in the public communication reinforce common stereotypes. The smallest ration in the verb 'state' likely comes from the fact that the act of 'stating' is typically performed by highly ranked officials, which are rarely women.   

##### 7.4  How do they compare to the findings in Section 4 and Section 5? 


- There are more feminine forms in verb participles than in nouns denoting occupations 
- The difference might come from the fact that masculine forms of the nouns denoting occupations can be used for women too
- The difference might also come from the fact that women are more rarely associated wit occupations than with actions (or states) denoted with the three verbs

#### \*8. Use the "Frequency" button in the NoSketchEngine menu on the left side of the interface to visualise the ratios in 6 as horizontal bar plots. Capture your plots and include them here:


We need concordances for both forms in one regular expression.





##### 8.1 *misliti* 'think' 


Enter **[lemma="misliti" & tag="Vmp-.[mf]"]** in the CQL search field

On the left-hand menu click on the **Node forms** under **Frequency** button.

<img src="images\Capture5-1.JPG" alt="web page 5-1" width="610"/>

A horizontal bar graph appears with a visual representation of the frequencies relative to all the forms covered by the MSD tags from the search:


<img src="images\Capture5-2.JPG" alt="web page 5-2" width="410"/>


<br />

We can see that the difference is the biggest in the plural forms.

### Part four: Summary and conclusions 

---

- What do corpora tell us about gender bias in the society? 
    - Social biases are not directly mapped on the use of language: the bias appears stronger in less prestigious occupations, while we know that it is weaker
    - Common believes about social roles are indeed visible in corpora (women feel more than they think)
    - The gender of certain verbs' subjects (e.g. of the verb 'state') is potentially more revealing of the real biases than the use of feminine form in the nouns denoting occupations  

<br />

- What have we learned about regional variation?
    - There seems to be a regional pattern following the level of economical development: the strongest biases tend to be in Serbia and the weakest in Slovenia
    - While there are some differences between regions, ratios between feminine and masculine forms still follow a rather similar pattern
    - Regional differences are bigger in the use of nominal forms than in the use of verb participles, indicating the impact of explicit regulation in this domain 

<br />


- Are there any surprising findings? If yes, why are they surprising?
    - The stronger bias against feminine forms in the nouns denoting occupations with a lower social prestige was surprising. A direct (linear) mapping between the state in a society and the number of mentions in language corpora, which we assumed before this finding, would mean many more feminine forms in this category
    - A rather consistent use of feminine forms in the nouns denoting occupations in Montenegro was also somewhat surprising as it does not follow the expected regional pattern described above. It was especially surprising compared to a common perception of this region as conservative, which might turn out to be a false belief in the domain of occupations
